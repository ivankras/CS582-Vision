        Machine Learning models are used to predict data of interest using known data as input.
        Neural Networks provide a mechanism to get into specific details of the input data and capture patterns that the human by itself is incapable of.
        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are perform well specifically for matrix-like inputs (in particular, images).\\
        Neural Transfer Learning is an application for CNNs based on paying attention to the intermediate layers
        of a network, disregarding a potential prediction and taking abstract features such as \emph{content} and \emph{style}.
        Applied to images, this represents the possibility of altering the artistic side of an image while keeping its content.\\
        In this project, we implement this idea of Image Transfer Learning, and apply it to different pairs of content/style images,
        to compare the results modifying the weights parameters.
        Additionally, we provide an API to use the project and make it available in a containerized solution.
