We used Conda to manage the development environment and requirements, which made dockerization very simple, our Dockerfile installs all the requirements from a text file that specifies the exact versions using PIP, then creates an image for the API and exposes the Flask server's ports to handle incoming requests.
To do:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enable GPU support within the container, accepting hardware and driver specs as parameters when building
\end{itemize}
