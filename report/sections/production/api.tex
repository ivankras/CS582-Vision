We're using Flask to serve the basic functionality of the model as RESTful API endpoints, as well as to provide necessary outputs to the frontend.\\
For now, the API only serves two endpoints
\begin{itemize}
    \item "api/getDefault": POST endpoint that accepts two urls, "structure" and "style" in the body and returns an image after a default number of style transfer iterations.
    \item "api/getResult": POST endpoint that accepts several optional parameters for the model, such as number of iterations, optimization technique, weight values, and returns an image from the final iteration.
\end{itemize}
